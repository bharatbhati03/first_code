            <p>
              Subhas Chandra Bose ( 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an
              Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India
              made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with
              Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by
              authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The
              honorific Netaji (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was first applied to
              Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the
              Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the
              Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout
              India.
              <br />
              Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali
              family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an
              Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to
              take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with
              distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the
              routine final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling.
              Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement
              led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He
              followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the
              Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more
              open to socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938.
              After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the
              Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of
              British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had
              grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable
              attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for
              himself. After the large majority of the Congress Working
              Committee members resigned in protest, Bose resigned as president
              and was eventually ousted from the party.
